    "# Offline, Multimodal Function Calling with Gemma: A Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling is a powerful construct that allows large language models like Gemma to use tools and interact with external APIs. It empowers Gemma to go beyond just generating text and actually do real world tasks for you, like checking the weather, booking a flight, keeping track of your expenses, and much much more! Combined with Gemma's multimodal capabilities and offline nature, function calling opens up a lot of amazing possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of function calling, and how to make use of it with Gemma 3's multimodal capabilities running offline on your computer. Here's a peak of a conversation you'll be having by the end of this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>user</em>\n",
    "> [[image of bill](media/bill.jpg)]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Add this to my expenses, and let me know if I'm going over my food budget of 1000 this month.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>model</em>\n",
    "> You've spent a total of 1278.5 on food this month, which exceeds your budget of 1000 by 278.5. It looks like that dinner at TSC put you over the limit!"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to work with for this tutorial. Say you've already written some code for a simple expense tracker in Python. Your code has two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `make_expense_entry` (to record expenses)\n",
    "- `get_expense_entries` (to filter expenses)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, using this code would require building a separate application to handle user input (things like the amount, category, and date of each transaction) and display data (like the stored transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we could make this process much easier? What if you could simply send a picture of a bill to Gemma and have it automatically add the expense to your tracker? Or ask Gemma to summarize your spending and help you stay within a monthly budget?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly what we'll explore today - using Gemma to discover and call your existing Python functions, turning natural language requests into automated actions. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and setup the necessary tools\n",
    "2. Write the Python functions for our simple expense tracker\n",
    "3. Write specifications for our functions so the model can discover them\n",
    "4. Select and download a multimodal Gemma model\n",
    "5. Instruct the model on how to call our functions\n",
    "6. Bring it all together and use the now intelligent expense tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first step - installing the necessary tools!"

    "- [`ollama`](https://ollama.com) to run the models locally on your computer\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "uv --version\n",
    "ollama --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, start `ollama` by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ollama serve\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In another terminal, clone this repository and open the notebook by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/gamemaker1/gemma3-function-calling-tutorial.git\n",
